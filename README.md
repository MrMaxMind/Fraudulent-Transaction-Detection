## Data Exploration and Cleaning
- **Data Loading**: The dataset is read and the first few rows are displayed.
- **Data Types**: The variable types in each column are identified and converted as necessary.
- **Null Values**: Null or missing values in the dataset are verified.
- **Statistical Information**: Statistical information about the variables is displayed.
- **Class Distribution**: The percentage of non-fraud and fraud transactions is calculated.

## Feature Engineering
- **Categorical Encoding**: Converting categorical features to numerical values using one-hot encoding.
- **Error Calculation**: Creating new features by calculating errors in the original and destination balances.
- **Outlier Removal**: Identifying and removing outliers from numerical columns.

---

## Model Building and Evaluation
- **Data Splitting**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
- **Scaling**: Features are scaled using StandardScaler.
- **Model Training**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost classifiers are trained on the scaled data.
- **Predictions**: The trained models make predictions on the test set.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance is measured using Confusion Matrix, Classification Report, and various metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score).
